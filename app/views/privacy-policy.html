We want you to feel confident that the information we collect, and that you choose to share, will be treated with care.

It is our sincere hope that by being forthright in this communication of our PPTU that the relationship we establish is a long-lasting one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please read this entire PPTU carefully each time you visit any of our websites, since we reserve the right to add, modify and/or delete any portions of this PPTU at any time.  If you do not agree to this PPTU, then you are not authorized to use our websites, and you should exit the websites. This PPTU does not apply to websites, web content & forms or framed/linked third party web content that we do not own, nor does it apply to any of our business customer websites, web content & forms, framed/linked third party web content or business practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        This PPTU is published based on applicable Federal & State Laws regarding the collection, storage and distribution of your information in the form of (i) non-public personal information which consists of any information about you that is not publicly available, and (ii) public personal information which consists of any publicly available information about you. Non-public personal information and public personal information are referred to collectively as “personal information”.  This PPTU describes how we use such personal information, and how we protect your privacy. We collect, store and distribute personal information to enable us to administer the ongoing business activities that we license to our business customers for the purpose of managing interactive marketing and media campaigns on search engines and websites. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
      </p>

      <p>
        This PPTU does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people we do not employ or manage. Our websites may contain hyperlinks to third party websites.

      </p><br />

      <h4>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h4>

      <p>
        We collect your personal information when you register with us, when you use our products or services, or when you visit our web pages or the pages of certain of our partners. We may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.
      </p>

      <p>
        During a normal visit to our websites, no personal information about you is collected. All information is free to browse at your leisure without the need for you to provide us with any personal information. Your visit does however generate a session log. When you visit any website, the server housing the pages automatically generates a "session log." The logs are used by the owners of the sites to track the pages you visit or request. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the website that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits. We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used.
      </p>

      <p>
        To ensure that our consumers receive the best Internet experience, we collect and store information regarding the demographics of our consumers, statistical trends, submission trends, website traffic information, frequency of visit, sales transaction information, search engine referral information, keyword modeling, consumer location and consumer provided information via website submission forms and tracking phone numbers. Please note that submission forms often require consumers to provide personal information about themselves including name, phone, email, address, vehicle information, trade information, buying status, general comments, social security number and other private financial information.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you register for the download of our products or services, we may ask for information such as your name, date of birth, gender, email address, and general location. We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. Log data is only used in aggregate to analyze usage of our website.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use your personal information for the following general purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will not contact minor children about special offers or for marketing purposes.
      </p><br />

      <h3>Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information</h3><br />

      <p>
        We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Upon submission of any information or form from our websites, the information you submitted may be promptly distributed to an affiliated dealer network as determined solely by us. Once your information (including any personal information) has been distributed from us to any third party or affiliated dealer network, your information becomes subject to the respective privacy policy of that third party or affiliated party who has a separate and independent obligation to use and protect your information for its intended purpose by endeavoring to use your information to assist you with the research and possible purchase of an automotive vehicle, service visit, parts purchase, general information request, vehicle financing and/or other automotive activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          We provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with us under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to (1) help us communicate with you about offers from us and our marketing partners or (2) deliver products and services you have ordered from us; provided, however, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information;
        </li>
        <li>
          We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
        </li>
        <li>
          We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property, violations of our PPTU, any misuse or unauthorized use of our website, or as otherwise required by law; or
        </li>
        <li>
          We transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merge with another company.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We may display targeted advertisements from time to time based on your personal information. We do not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. Our advertisers may assume that if you interact with, view, or click on targeted ads, then you meet the targeting criteria. We may work with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in industries and categories of business different from ours.
      </p>

      <p>
        We reserve the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding visitors to our websites for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. This is not your personal information, only general summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        From time to time, we may offer products or services from our partners or third parties. Where you are so notified during the purchase process, your information may be shared with the provider of the product or service.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site may be monitored by VisiCogn monitoring software, and may capture information about your visit that will help us improve the quality of our service.
      </p><br />

      <h4>Modification and Deletion of Personal Information</h4>
      <p>
        When you use our websites, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. Where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
      </p><br />

      <h4>Information in Public Forums</h4>

      <p>
        If we choose to offer any form of public forum in which you may post comments, any information you disclose when posting a message in any such area will become public and may be used by us for related online and offline promotional uses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any personally identifiable information you submit in a public forum can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these public forums. In order to avoid your e-mail address or other personal information from being gathered and used by others for inappropriate or harmful purposes, we advise that you should be cautious about posting a real e-mail address or other personal information to newsgroups, chats, or other public forums.
      </p><br />

      <h4>Confidentiality and Security</h4>

      <p>
        We limit access to personal information about you to employees and contractors who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect your information.
      </p><br />

      <h4>To Protect Information</h4>

      <p>
        We have internal and external policies, procedures, secure databases and server firewalls along with employee training, monitoring and auditing in place to protect the personal information of our consumers.
      </p><br />

      <h4>Opting Out Of The Database</h4>

      <p>
        If you would like to opt-out of our database to keep your information from being submitted to a marketing partner, please send us an email to privacy@Dealertrack.com with “opt-out” in the subject line along with your complete name, address and phone number, and your submitted form information will be opted-out of our database.  Any information already submitted to marketing partners will need to be opted-out by you directly with that party.  Anonymous statistical data regarding your website shopping trends and footsteps through our website may not be opted-out because any data compilations that relate this information to you have been blocked from external view.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you feel that a minor child may have furnished information without parental notice or consent, please send us an email to privacy@Dealertrack.com with “minor” in the subject line along with the minor’s complete name, address and phone number, and this information will be permanently removed from our database.
      </p><br />

If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2007 will receive information regarding 2006 sharing activities).
      </p>

      <p>
        To obtain this information on behalf of us, please send an email message to privacy@Dealertrack.com with "Request for California Privacy Information" on the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your e-mail address in response. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.

      <h4>Communications</h4>

      <p>
        We may send you marketing and other communications from time to time.

      </p><br />

      <h4>Downloadable Files</h4>

      <p>
        Downloading files refers to the act of choosing to receive a file or program from a website. Examples are a web browser, a sound file, movie file or screensaver. Downloadable files are usually executables. Meaning that once they are downloaded, clicking on them launches or installs a program or deposits files on your computer. Whenever you download a file from a website, you will always be given the choice of where you would like to save the file. Unless you explicitly trust the site delivering the downloadable, it is a good idea to save the file to disk before opening or activating it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We sometimes use downloadable files to deliver our products and/or services. If information on our site requires a particular piece of software to view it, we will provide a link for you to acquire that software. Examples are plugins for your browser that allow you to view files like Macromedia Flash or Shockwave, Adobe Acrobat, the Quick Time player or Real Player. We rarely, if ever, will require you to download an uncommon piece of software or program to view our information.
      </p><br />

      <h4>Third Parties</h4>

      <p>
        With respect to any agreement between you and any third party, you agree and acknowledge that we do not intend to interfere with any contractual agreement between you and a third party, and you promise to perform fully your obligations under any such contract. You agree and acknowledge that it is your sole responsibility to perform such obligations. You promise not to use our services and products if such use would breach any term, material or otherwise, of any such agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of, any third party found on or through our services or products, including, without limitation, payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such third party. You agree and acknowledge that we are not, and will not be, responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of any such dealings, and you promise to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from any liability asserted against us as a result of any such dealings.
      </p><br />

      <h4>Hyperlink Disclaimer</h4>

      <p>
        As part of our services and/or products, we, or a third party, may provide links to other World Wide Web content, sites, services, or resources. You acknowledge we have no editorial control over such content, sites, services, or resources, and you agree and acknowledge such links are not express or implied endorsements or approvals by us of any such content, sites, services, or resources. You agree and acknowledge that we (i) are not responsible for the availability of such external content, sites, services, or resources, and (ii) do not endorse, and are not responsible or liable for, any content available from such sites, services, or resources. You agree and acknowledge we are not, and will not be liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused, or alleged to be caused, by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, sites, services, or resources.
      </p><br />

      <h4>Cookies and Beacons</h4>

      <p>
        We may set and access our “cookies” on your computer in order to track your usage of our website. We may let other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not these PPTU. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to our cookies. If you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use all the features of our products and services.  Third party cookies may also be used on our websites to place a unique cookie on your browser for tracking and marketing purposes.  Any information collected via these cookies is anonymous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our advertisers and we may elect to use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a., “web beacons,” “web bugs,” or “action tags”) to help better manage advertising and traffic on our website. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser’s server or our server about your online movements. We do not have access to any information collected by the clear gifs of our advertisers.
      </p><br />

      <h4>Detecting Your System’s Performance Level</h4>

      <p>
        Sometimes, prior to serving a web page, a web server will use a simple html program to check the speed of your Internet connection or the existence of certain plugins or software. An example would be to detect which version of a particular browser you are using or which version of the Macromedia Flash plug-in you have. Once identified, the server delivers the page or Flash movie to match the performance level or version of the software or plug-in in your system. The benefit is that you always see the content in its optimum state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not all website owners do this simply because it means having to build multiple versions of content. In fact, most simply offer a statement on their homepage to the effect that "This site is best viewed using Microsoft IE 4.0 and/or Netscape 4.0 etc."
      </p>

      <p>
        With our website, we sometimes check your Internet connection speed in order to deliver multimedia content such as streaming video or audio at its optimum viewing level.
      </p><br />

      <h4>Intellectual Property</h4>

      <p>
        Most of the text, images, graphics, animation, videos, music, sounds and other materials on this site are subject to trademark, copyright and other intellectual property rights, and such rights are owned by us, our affiliated companies, licensors and/or third parties.

      </p>

      <p>

      <p>
        You hereby waive any and all rights in any Communications, and we will be free to copy, disclose, distribute, display, perform, create derivative works, incorporate and otherwise use the Communications for any and all purposes, commercial or non-commercial.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Modifications to Our Services or Products</strong></p>
